# Disco-Calculator
This is a calculator I made in Java. 
I named it Disco calculator because the colors in the calculator change everytime you run it. 
Go ahead! Try it out 

## How to run: 
I used JDK 11 for this. 
You should have it installed in your machine 
Then all you need to do is compile it using your command line: 
`javac DiscoCalculator.java`
And then run it by: 
`java DiscoCalculator`
